I'm Cameron - a data scientist from Toronto, and MSc student at Oxford and the Oxford Internet Institute reading Social Data Science. I'm also a graduate from Queen's University where I studied computer science and political science. My broad interests include network science, machine learning, and computational social science.

Previously, I worked as a research scientist at the University of Toronto studying [community embeddings](http://csslab.cs.toronto.edu/gs/) with Dr. Ashton Anderson.

With previous coursework and research studying the politics of artificial intelligence; neural and genetic computing; and reinforcement learning I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and society.
