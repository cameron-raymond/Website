I'm Cameron - a data scientist from Toronto, and research fellow at Stanford Law School's RegLab. Previously I was a graduate student at Oxford where I did research on misinformation and human-computer interaction at the Oxford Internet Institute. I'm also a graduate from Queen's University where I studied computer science and political science. My (very) broad interests include causal inference, machine learning, human-computer interaction and computational social science.
