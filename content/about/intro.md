I'm Cameron ‚Äì¬†a data scientist from Toronto. Right now I'm a research fellow at Stanford where I work with government agencies to leverage emerging technology and causal inference to inform policy. I recently finished my MSc at Oxford where I researched misinformation and human-computer interaction. Before that I was doing my undergrad at Queen's University studying computer science and political science. I've been lucky enough to work and do research at institutions like the University of Toronto's Computational Social Science Lab; Princeton's Stigma and Social Perception Lab; Stanford's Regulation Evaluation and Governance Lab; and the Oxford Internet Institute. I've had my work featured at conferences like [ICWSM](https://www.icwsm.org), [IC2S2](http://ic2s2.org), INSNA's [Sunbelt](https://www.insna.org/sunbelt-archives) conference and [MISDOOM](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/misdoom-2021/).

If my previous experience spanning computer science, data science, policy, psychology, HCI and computational social science sounds broad, that's because it is! The through line, though, is that I'm passionate about applying technology and data to important social issues. My (very) general interests include causal inference, machine learning, human-computer interaction and computational social science.
