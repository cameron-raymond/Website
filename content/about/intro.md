I'm Cameron - a data scientist from Toronto, and recent CS and PoliSci graduate from Queen’s University. In the fall I'll be joining Oxford and the Oxford Internet Institute to do my MSc in Social Data Science. At Oxford I'll continue studying network science, machine learning, and computational social science.

Right now I'm a research scientist at the University of Toronto working on [community embeddings](http://csslab.cs.toronto.edu/gs/) with Dr. Ashton Anderson.

With previous coursework and research studying the Politics of Artificial Intelligence; Neural and Genetic Computing; and Reinforcement Learning I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and society.
