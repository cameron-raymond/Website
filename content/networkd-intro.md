## Welcome to Networkd

‚ÄúNetworks are important because if we don‚Äôt understand networks, we can‚Äôt understand how markets function, organizations solve problems or how societies change.‚Äù ‚Äî Duncan Watts

Hello and welcome to Networkd, a blog dedicated to uncovering the social world through network science, artificial intelligence (AI), and computational social science. I‚Äôm Cameron, Networkd‚Äôs founder. I am an incoming MSc student at the University of Oxford studying [Social Data Science](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/). Over the coming months, Networkd will serve as an *accessible* *outlet* for the exciting but all too often *inaccessible* research done in the world of computational social science. This intro to Networkd will give the justification for why opening up this research is a good thing, and set the foundation for further exploration into the world of networks and computation.

### **Why Networks?**üï∏

The (SEO optimizedüòâ) namesake of this blog says a lot about the role of computational social science in the 21À¢·µó century. Hidden dynamics in our everyday world are often patterned by the relationships we have with our governments, cities, technology and each other. Network science is a way to uncover, quantify, and investigate these relationships. As Watts‚Äô, the UPenn sociologist, illustrated ‚Äî networks are everywhere. As such, the use of graphs to formalize these relationships are useful tools. We will define and explore graph‚Äôs in more depth next week. As we will see, the patterns exhibited in these networks can answer questions about the spread of information and disease; whether the ‚Äú6 degrees of separation‚Äù rule actually holds; how marketer‚Äôs find social media influencers; how bad political polarization has gotten and more.

#### Avoiding the Sociological Meat Grinder

The social sciences often ask questions about people‚Äôs behaviour, preferences, struggles, and how organizations (social media, governments, civic organizations) affect our lives. And while it may seem intuitive to focus on the ways individuals and organizations interact, and the influence they have on one another ‚Äî this is not how research is always conducted. Traditionally, if a researcher wanted to know how individuals felt about a particular subject they would conduct a survey, and try to parse out from people‚Äôs answers the *nature* of the thing they were studying. This is what Columbia sociologist Allen Barton called the *sociological meat grinder, *which he famously described below in 1968.
> ‚ÄúFor the last thirty years, empirical social research has been dominated by the sample survey. But as usually practiced, using random sampling of individuals, the survey is a sociological meat grinder, tearing the individual from their social context and guaranteeing that nobody in the study interacts with anyone else in it. It is a little like a biologist putting their experimental animals through a hamburger machine and looking at every hundredth cell through a microscope; anatomy and physiology get lost, structure and function disappear, and one is left with cell biology‚Ä¶. If our aim is to understand people‚Äôs behavior rather than simply to record it, we want to know about primary groups, neighborhoods, organizations, social circles, and communities; about interaction, communication, role expectations, and social control.‚Äù ‚Äî Allen Barton

We can‚Äôt ignore the world we live in, and all its complexities and interdependencies, when asking about the social world. Networks and their analysis are a great tool to have in your toolbox.

### **Why AI and Computational Social Science?**üß†

Networkd is a blog about how our relationships can explain interesting and important phenomena in our world. Often, the best way to do this is by creating some sort of network with the relevant data; however, this is far from the only way to avoid the sociological meat grinder, and this blog will often draw on other useful tools as well.

The data that we‚Äôll draw upon is often collected from the internet, a great example of a massively important network (it is the world wide *web* after all). This means that our data are often sparse, in the form of text or images, and that there is a lot of it. AI can help group and categorize this data in a way that makes its exploration that much easier. This will be shown in the coming weeks, when we look at how the tweets of different political leaders served dramatically different purposes, depending on what the tweet was about. AI is helpful because, to a computer, it‚Äôs not exactly clear what a tweet is ‚Äúabout‚Äù. Computational social science refers to the use of computation to answer social science questions. Since the questions this blog will look at are often about how digital technology is changing our world, and there are a lot of data to collect, computational methods allow us to achieve breadth in our work.

### Let‚Äôs get Startedüï∫üíÉ

Network science, AI and computational social science are far from the only ways to explore the social world. Survey‚Äôs and qualitative work are undoubtedly important as well. This blog simply aims to shed light on tools that are sometimes ignored in the social sciences; tools that are extremely interesting, fun to look at, and uncover compelling evidence about our world. My aim is to have one blog post per week. These may be overviews of important concepts in network science/graph theory, interviews with social or data scientists, or deep dives on my own work. I‚Äôll have copies of all the blog posts, as well as links to the original papers and source code on my website ([cameronraymond.me](https://cameronraymond.me/?utm_source=medium.com&utm_medium=referral)). I am also looking for active or occasional contributors to Networkd, and would love to encourage collaboration across all disciplines!

With all that said I hope Networkd serves a few purposes: I hope it will be an outlet for the interesting research that‚Äôs done in the world of computational social science ‚Äî and I hope it brings this research further into the domain of dinner table conversations, making it more accessible to everyone.
