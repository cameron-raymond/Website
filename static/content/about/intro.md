I'm Cameron ‚Äì¬†a data scientist from Toronto. I'm a member of OpenAI's Trust & Safety staff where I work to detect and intervene on platform abuse of OpenAI's technologies. Previously I was a research fellow at Stanford where I worked with government agencies to leverage emerging technology and causal inference to inform policy. I completed my MSc at Oxford where I researched misinformation and human-computer interaction. My undergraduate training was at Queen's University in computer science and political science.

I've been lucky enough to work and do research at institutions like the University of Toronto's Computational Social Science Lab; Princeton's Stigma and Social Perception Lab; Stanford's Regulation Evaluation and Governance Lab; and the Oxford Internet Institute. I've had my work accepted to conferences like [ICWSM](https://www.icwsm.org), [IC2S2](http://ic2s2.org), INSNA's [Sunbelt](https://www.insna.org/sunbelt-archives) conference and [MISDOOM](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/misdoom-2021/).

If my previous experience sounds broad, that's because it is! I break my background into three components: the problem space, the methods, and the interventions. The problems I'm interested in surround how we as a collective interact with technology and how it can be used and misused, specifically for political communication. Answering these questions often requires lots of data. I use computational methods that are able to process massive data sets to drive clear insights. Finally, these insights allow me to develop and test interventions rooted in behavioral science that can improve our use of technology. This involves designing experiments and using causal inference techniques to test and iterate on new policies. From soup-to-nuts I try to conduct rigorous, transparent science.
