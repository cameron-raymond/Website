I'm Cameron ‚Äì¬†a data scientist from Toronto. I'm a member of OpenAI's Trust & Safety staff where I work to detect and intervene on platform abuse of OpenAI's technologies. Previously I was a research fellow at Stanford where I worked with government agencies to leverage emerging technology and causal inference to inform policy. I completed my MSc at Oxford where I researched misinformation and human-computer interaction. I did my undergrad at Queen's University in computer science and political science.

I've been lucky enough to work and do research at institutions like the University of Toronto's Computational Social Science Lab; Princeton's Stigma and Social Perception Lab; Stanford's Regulation Evaluation and Governance Lab; and the Oxford Internet Institute. I've had my work accepted to venues like [ICWSM](https://www.icwsm.org), [IC2S2](http://ic2s2.org), INSNA's [Sunbelt](https://www.insna.org/sunbelt-archives) conference, [MISDOOM](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/misdoom-2021/), [The Lancet *eclinicalmedicine*](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/home) and [TrustCon](https://www.tspa.org/event/trustcon-2023/).

My broad background is characterized by three areas. First, the problem space: I want to understand how technology shapes the ways we come together as a collective. Second, the methods: I use novel computational methods that are able to make sense of the massive amounts of behavioural data that the internet produces. Third, the interventions: I design and test interventions to inform policy decisions on emerging tech. From soup-to-nuts I try to conduct rigorous, transparent science.
